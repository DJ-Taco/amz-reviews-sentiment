Its obviously not a 1 to 1 taste to normal (with sugar) milk tea. Its just the monk fruit that has a ""taste"". If you're use to alternative sweeteners or monk fruit i don't think you would notice the taste so this would be a perfect. I stop noticing the flavor discrepancy after 2-4 sips then it taste completely fine. Do not try using boiling water or anything hot to dissolve or mix this will make the protein powder curdle and it'll be like drinking cottage cheese. I did this and gave the product the benefit of the doubt after googling how protein powder works. If it clumps most likely whatever you used as your liquid was to hot.

From the first sip, I knew this was going to be a struggle. The flavor struck me as overwhelmingly artificial, with a strange bitterness and a lingering chalky sweetness that made it hard to finish even half a serving. I expected something that reminded me of a rich Vietnamese iced coffee, but what I got was closer to a miscalibrated protein shake with hints of coffee extract and something chemically sweet. Honestly, I gagged. I found the price—$49.99—to be almost insulting. For that cost, I expect either an exceptional flavor or nutritional payoff. This gave me neither. The idea of combining 25g of grass-fed whey protein isolate with boba tea elements sounds innovative, but in practice, it just doesn’t work. You end up with a drink that satisfies neither craving: it’s not rich and creamy like boba tea, and it’s not clean and neutral like a proper protein shake. It’s the worst of both worlds, and at this price point, it feels like a waste of money. I did try to salvage it. I mixed it with milk, added ice, blended it into a smoothie, even tried masking it with cinnamon or cocoa powder—but nothing made the flavor tolerable. The drink has a weird after-feel that made my teeth feel squeaky and unpleasantly coated, possibly from the monk fruit sweetener or coconut oil creamer. The gritty texture never really went away either, no matter how well I shook or blended it. The worst part is that it left me feeling unsatisfied and slightly annoyed. I kept thinking: if I want boba tea, I’ll get a real one. If I want a protein shake, there are far better, more palatable options. Combining the two sounds fun in theory, but this version didn’t deliver. It felt like the product was trying too hard to be trendy without nailing the basics of taste and drinkability. I’m giving this product 1.5 out of 5 stars, mostly because the nutritional content and ingredient transparency are solid on paper—but the execution failed spectacularly. I just couldn’t bring myself to keep drinking it, and most of it ended up in the trash.",False,0,Flavor Name: Vietnamese Coffee Size: 19 Servings,Vietnamese Coffee,2025-05-26,2025-05-01,0.2985,pos

The price was on the high side, considering I could get Optimum Nutrition for way less money and I go through protein fairly quickly. I thought about it for a while until I decided to just go for it. I mixed it like the instructions said, 4oz water / 4 oz milk + 1 scoop of powder. I had very high expectations given all the 5 star reviews, but now I'm wondering whether all those people were either 1) shills, 2) never had milk tea in their lives. There is a strong tea taste somewhere in there I'll give you that, but it does not taste like the black milk tea you can get at a boba shop. Drinking this leaves a strong bitter lingering note in my mouth after taking a few sips (from the black tea) so that's also a downside. All in all it doesn't come anywhere near satisfying my milk tea cravings. I think I would be better off brewing the tea at home myself and adding fairlife + whey powder to make my own milk tea protein drink. I can see what they were trying to do, but this is just not it. I don't think I'll ever be buying this again. I guess I still need to finish the bag so we'll see if this grows on me.

The resealable bag holds 32 ounces of sandy colored powder made up of 100% grass-fed whey protein isolate, coconut oil creamer, 100% Vietnamese Robusta Coffee, monk fruit extract, and salt. To make a serving you just need to mix 1 scoop of powder with 8-10 ounces of chilled water and shake in a protein shaker cup. You can also use various combinations of milk (traditional or plant based) and water to change the consistency and make it creamier. I opted to use 10 ounces of chilled water. The powder dissolved easily and left no residue at the base of the cup. It had an intoxicating and inviting aroma of coffee. The drink is light and the initial flavor is a delicious coffee.  But the sip transforms and finishes on a very cloyingly sweet note that coated my palate and remained strong long after I had finished the drink.

It’s Truly Grass Fed-certified, 99.99% lactose-free, and mixes smoothly without the chalky texture of lower-quality proteins. With 25g of protein per serving, it’s a solid pick for daily protein intake—but not the best choice for post-workout recovery. What You Need to Know Before Buying: ✔ Tastes Like Real Milk Tea – Smooth, creamy, and lightly sweet with no stevia aftertaste. ✔ High-Quality Whey Isolate – Boba Tea Protein sources its whey from Irish grass-fed dairy. ✔ Contains Caffeine – Classic Milk Tea has 121mg per serving, which might not be ideal after workouts. ✔ Easy to Mix – Dissolves well in a shaker bottle with minimal clumping. Why Not 5 Stars? Not the Best for Recovery – The fat content (4g) and caffeine could slow digestion post-workout. Protein Efficiency is Lower – With 66% protein per serving, it’s less efficient than other isolates at this price. If you’re looking for a high-protein milk tea alternative, Boba Tea Protein is a great option. Just know it’s more about flavor than muscle recovery. Final Grade: ⭐⭐⭐⭐✨ (4.5/5) Would I buy it again? Yes—for taste. Not as a post-workout shake.",False,0,Flavor Name: Classic Milk Tea Size: 25 Servings,Classic Milk Tea,2025-02-14,2025-02-01,0.8652,pos

Because of the caffeine it's only good for the mornings. If I haven't had my protein shake I can't use this mid day...so if you're sensitive to caffeine this is something you would need to consider.

I then heated up a mason jar (just put under hot tap water so it doesn't crack when you put in the hot water from the Keurig/tea kettle/etc.) put in your 6 oz of hot water in. I then have one of those metal blender balls, I put it in the mason jar. On the bag it says to use one scoop, however I liked using half of a scoop, I like the taste better. I then put the lid on and shake, it literally takes maybe 5-10 sec of shaking to see visibly no clumps, I do it for an additional 20 sec just to be sure. Then put it into ice, and then add your choice of milk. By doing all of that, the Mixability and texture is 10/10, no gross grittiness, clumps, or gross aftertaste. I even like to add a little creamer or strawberry syrup to give it a little more sweetness or different flavor. Taste- If you don't like black tea, this isn't for you. It tastes much like black tea. It's not an overwhelming taste. Value for money- Now I don't know if it is, since I just got it, however, because I like it as half of a scoop it could get me close to 50 servings instead of the 25.",True,5,Flavor Name: Classic Milk Tea Size: 25 Servings,Classic Milk Tea,2025-01-14,2025-01-01,0.9749,pos
